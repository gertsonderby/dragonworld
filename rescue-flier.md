Rescue Flier
============

Brave dragons who set out to find those who are lost, retrieve those who cannot get home, and bring help to the needy, the fliers of the various rescue organizations are a compassionate, persistent, and perceptive lot. Their job involves flying into inclement weather, tall mountains, deep forests and other hazardous circumstances, to rescue dragons in distress. They typically work in teams and larger dragons may carry crews of small dragons.

Career
------

### Qualifications

To become a rescue flier it is necessary to prove your physical and mental resilience, first of all. Strong long-distance flight ability is a must. Only the strongest of bodies can withstand storms, blizzards, or flights at great height and duration, while a staunch mind is required to withstand the pressures of the job - and the occasional failed mission, when you arrive too late to help. As well, a compassionate mindset and good discipline are helpful to the rescue flier candidate.

### Career Progression

A starting rescue flier spends most of their time training and practicing. There are many aspects of the job that require significant learning, and building rapport with their teams and crew is also a major part of the work.

The first real mission is a watershed moment for a rescuer. Depending on circumstances, this can range from exhausting but low-risk flights to bring supplies to relive a desperate situation, to grueling night rides into raging storms to find and rescue survivors of a shipwreck. Not all rescue fliers survive their first missions, and not all survive without injury. However, once the mission is done, the young flier is a full and respected member of their group.

Depending on skills and inclinations, the career of a rescue flier can lead to positions as mission planner, flight leader, and other positions of higher responsibility. Some rescue organizations use a paramilitary hierarchy, others a less formal structure, so the names of positions are very culture-dependent. Typically, however, officers will take care of jobs such as logistical planning, human and dragon assignments, mission plans, and field and/or overall command.

### Payment & Reimbursement

Payment is not as high as might be expected from a job as strenuous and dangerous as this, generally, though it is by no means low. Most rescue fliers live on solid economic ground, with room in their economies for savings, owning minor property, and/or supporting dependents in comfort.

### Other Benefits

The social credit of being a rescue flier is high in all lands. It's a rare rescue flier who has to buy their own drinks or meals out and about, and they can usually draw a crowd telling tales of their missions. Media acknowledgement of their work is also significant. The kind of personality that supports being a rescue flier will usually not let this go to their head, though occasionally younger rescuers have trouble maintaining perspective.

Significant effort goes into maintaining the health and strength of rescue organizations and their fliers, which generally means access to good healthcare and psychological assistance, as well as other helpful benefits.

Perception
----------

### Purpose

Location, relief and rescue of injured or lost people in hazardous environmental conditions. Rescue and relief work in case of natural disaster.

### Social Status

Prestigious, but working class. Dangerous, valued work, sought after by non-privileged classes, considered a bit below gauge for aristocrats.

### Demographics

Rescue fliers are not many, generally only a very few qualify for the job in the first place, and of them only a portion end up in active duty. A rare encounter outside of the areas where they are most found.

### History

At one time, being lost at sea, in mountains, or other wilderness meant almost certain death. Some militaries or equivalent would mount expeditions to try and find overdue groups, but the expertise was limited, as were resources.

Civil defense patrols for forest fires and other natural disasters were first formed as civil services became more codified and part of developing societal structures. Generally comprised of experiences wilderness rangers, both winged and not, these groups took on the responsibility of search and rescue when people went missing. Coast guards, tasked with handling shipping and order in coastal regions were formed around the same time, and soon began taking up the task of attempting to relieve distressed ships. These functions evolved and were gradually expanded into the plethora of current organizations.

Advancing technology made relief more effective and search more likely to succeed, allowing the rescue flights to garner the reputation they enjoy today.

Operations
----------

### Tools

Depending on size, a rescue dragon may be assigned a crew of smaller dragons, and will have a harness to carry them through the long flights of the job. They also typically will have bags or cargo webbing, allowing carriage of emergency supplies.

Navigation equipment is standard, ranging from maps and compasses to radio direction and range finders.

Communications equipment of as long range and strong reliability as can be found is paramount. Larger dragons will often act as base stations for radio communications on major missions, allowing smaller dragons to carry lighter radios with shorter range as they search for survivors.

### Dangers & Hazards

Rescuing others is by its nature dangerous. The conditions which caused the need for rescue will often endanger the rescuers, and see dragons flying into storms, over forest fires, close to volcanic eruptions, or other extremely hazardous skies. The terrain flown over can be just as perilous, consisting of wilderness, tall mountains, or the open ocean.

Not many would assault a rescue operation, but in times of warfare, unscrupulous commanders have attempted to prevent the rescue of enemy soldiers by force of arms, and trackless areas will occasionally hold bandits desperate enough to strike at a rescue flier.

Alternative Names:   Sky rangers, stormbirds, numerous nicknames on the theme of airborne rescue, such as saving angels.

Type:   Social Services

Demand:   Generally only found where there's a need, so in areas near stormy seas or mountains, large difficult-to-traverse plains and wildernesses, or other areas with many people who get lost.
