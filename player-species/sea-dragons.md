Sea dragons
===========

Almost every coast in the world has settlements of sea dragons, from tiny fishing hamlets to bustling port cities. Sea dragons are one of the few dragon species able to fly across seas on their own wing, and have played a major role in trade and communication between the different parts of the world as a consequence.

Basic Information
-----------------

### Anatomy & Morphology

Slender and with long, narrow wings, sea dragons are adapted for flying across open water and swimming in it both. Uniquely among dragons, their toes are webbed, as they use their hind limbs for steering in the water. Their ancestors roosted on sea cliffs and coastal islands, and modern sea dragons still retain robust claws on all four limbs, useful for rock climbing. Their bodies are covered mostly in smooth, short fur that both insulates against the water and improves hydrodynamic efficiency, and the typical crests and horns on their heads tend to be swept back or collapsible against the neck, making them **Strong swimmers and divers**.

An adult sea dragon can be expected to have a wingspan around 50 feet, and weighing in the vicinity of 1200 to 1500 lbs. Their wings have a high aspect ratio, being very narrow and long, suitable for **Long flights and soaring over open ocean**. Sea dragons are capable of flight dives into water, folding in their wings to pierce the surface in short dives from the air. This allows them to catch fish unaware, and is a popular type of sport fishing to this day.

### Steam blast (stunt)

The breath weapon of sea dragons is similar to their closest relatives, snow dragons, in that it is also a two-component volatile chemical mixture. But where snow dragons emit it as a fiery spray, sea dragons combine their reagents as a gob of heterogeneous slime which is then spit at high velocity - even underwater. Upon impact, the reagents contact each other and explosively flash into a hot blast of steam. On the surface, this can serve as an effective deterrent or tool -
underwater it becomes a highly dangerous weapon. The steam blast is capable of causing bone damage and internal bleeding on creatures directly hit.

### Ecology and Habitats

Originally adapted to the coasts and seas of the world, seaside settlements are still where sea dragons are mostly found, though some sea dragons take to the land life as well. They remain the species of dragon that has the most sailors.

### Dietary Needs and Habits

Sea dragons prefer seafood, but have taken well to land-based foods as well. Trading enables them to have a higher proportion of vegetable foods than otherwise.

Fishing, including for shellfish, clams etc., is a major part of sea dragon industry, and provides a majority of the food eaten by the species. Hunting larger sea creatures like [wingfins](/creatures/wingfins.md) or [sea serpents](/creatures/sea-serpents.md) is also common, though less so.

Civilization and Culture
------------------------

### Average Technological Level

Sea dragons take great pride in inventing the boat. Originally, they built floating baskets that helped them carry larger catches of fish home, then larger ones that they could tow or propel with wing beats. This developed into proper boats with streamlining, and the addition of sails made their use much cheaper in energy. Wooden hulls, better shaping, multiple masts and other adaptations and improvements followed.

### Culture and Cultural Heritage

Across the globe, sea dragons seem to all enjoy steam bathing. As such, coastal towns and cities without bath houses are nearly unheard of, and the baths are where sea dragons (and many other denizens of these places) will go to relax, meet friends, gossip, plan later events, or just plain warm up on a cold day. The plumbing for these baths can get quite complex, and the invention of the steam engine is widely thought to be inspired by sea dragon steam baths.

### Common Myths and Legends

A legend tells of the invention of the sail: A fisherdragon injured their wing at sea, and could not tow their boat home. Instead, they stretched their one good wing upwards, catching the wind and finding their way home. They then built a 'wing' of rod and cloth and mounted it on their boat to let the wind propel it. Different sea dragon peoples tell the story differently, but most of them have this legend, lending it some weight of truth.

Genetic Ancestor(s): [Dragons](/creatures/dragons.md)

Scientific Name:   Draco maris

Average Weight:   1300 lbs.

Average Length:   Wingspan of 50 feet.

Body Tint, Colouring and Marking:   Blues, greens and grays are common, occasionally in bright, startling nuances. Iridescence is uncommon, but found more in sea dragons than any other species. Countershading, where the underside is much lighter than the upper side, is very common, and can be as extreme as pure black and white in some individuals.
