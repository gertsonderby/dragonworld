Mountain dragons
================

Before they developed technology, mountain dragons hunted among the peaks and canyons, soaring on the thermal air currents to find prey. They returned to rest in caves they found or dug into cliff- and hillsides, often many of them together in colonies that became tribes of sorts. As a result of these origins, mountain dragons today remain excellent rock climbers and fliers both, and most of them prefer living social, industrious lives in the big cities they build.

Basic Information
-----------------

### Anatomy & Morphology

With a wingspan of about 30', these dragons are among the smaller forms. Their outer wings are short compared to the overall limb length, but the wing shape is broad and they have a large overall wing area, making them **Maneuverable and efficient fliers**.

The first to third digits of the wings are relatively short, muscular and robust, with blunt, strong claws suitable for digging sediment and prying rocks free. These make them **Good climbers and better burrowers**, but also make this species excellent metalworkers.

### Acid breath (stunt)

Mountain dragons generate a strongly corrosive mucus in their breath crop, allowing them to spew out a spray of acidic slime to cover a surface. This is useful against predators, as well as effective at weakening stone for digging through. Later, uses in metalworking have been found, using the acid to etch metallic surfaces.

### Ecology and Habitats

Most at home in the foothills and canyons of mountains, highlands and other elevated areas are where the majority of this species is found. There they herd mountain goats and sheep, mine for metals and other precious minerals, and build cities of warrens and burrows.

### Geographic Origin and Distribution

Most major mountain ranges and highlands of the world are home to populations of mountain dragons. They seem equally able to adapt to tropical plateaus as to subarctic gorges and hills.

Civilization and Culture

### Average Technological Level

Major metalworkers, still producers of a large portion of the world's metal stock and goods. The mountain cities are home to many mills, forges, smelteries and mines, and trade is vigorous among them in wares like mineral coal, different metals, tools and machine parts.

Steam engines are a recent development with mountain city origins. Based on impractical but interesting work by both foreign and domestic philosophers and scientists, the high precision manufacturing has become available to create reliable steam driven engines. They still remain quite large, however, and while the first railways have already proven useful for transporting cargoes, most engines are used as static power plants for industrial production.

The first cities, millennia ago, were warrens of caves and burrows in canyons among the mountains, and that pattern still remains. Modern cities take much from this pattern, even among the other species, but where no mountains or hills are available, constructed buildings are common, and still create a sense of canyons and hills with caves or burrows. Mountain life today is heavily urbanized, and cities have grown to sized previously undreamt of, with tens of thousands of dragons of all species living in close proximity.

### Common Etiquette Rules

Small gifts are always brought when visiting if you mean to enter a dwelling. It's customary to answer this by hosting a visitor for a meal.
