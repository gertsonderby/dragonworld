Great dragons
=============

The largest dragon species by almost two fold, the great dragons evolved from plains and light forest predators which mostly hunted from the ground.

Basic Information
-----------------

### Anatomy & Morphology

**Gigantic and powerful**, with robust skulls, strong jaws and muscular necks, great dragons are built for predation of animals close to their own size. Their wings are more tightly collapsible than those of other species, making ground movement much safer for them.

Great dragons are **Fast long-distance fliers**, flying easily at upwards of 150 miles per hour, with a short-duration sprint velocity of up to twice that. However, takeoff is energy intensive for them, and most will prefer to walk shorter distances where another species would fly.

### Thunderous roar (stunt)

Being mighty predators in their own right, the great dragon breath crop has been repurposed as a sounding bladder, leaving the dragons without a proper breath weapon. However, the thundering, low-pitched roar that this sounding bladder helps them produce is both powerfully loud and reaches into the infrasonic range, causing both physical pain and strange, nearly hallucination-like fear effects in close targets. It can also be pitched to be audible across extended range, and serves as an effective means of communication.

### Dietary Needs and Habits

Great dragons, while not obligate carnivores, require a high proportion of meat in their diet to stay healthy, and have high nutrient requirements from their size. The cuisine among them tends toward the simple but effective, with high carbohydrate and high fat ingredient foods being staples. Dishes are often derived from storage methods for travel food.

Civilization and Culture
------------------------

### Average Technological Level

Nomadic life and high carrying capacity in flight combined to favor engineering, allowing significant building material to be carried along as a family group travelled. Tents eventually became more permanent buildings, constructed in places where groups would congregate, and eventually gave rise to highly technical methods of constructing wooden and stone buildings. This in turn has made great dragon builders sought after among the other species.

### Culture and Cultural Heritage

In their past, great dragons were highly nomadic, a trait which did not change when they began to domesticate animals. They also tend to populate areas with wide open expanses, and have relatively low population numbers. As a result, their towns and even cities tend to be built outwards rather than upwards, with open spaces between buildings, which are rarely constructed so that flight is necessary to access them. It's rare for great dragons to remain their whole life where they hatch, instead moving to other settlements several times in their lives.

Their low-pitched roar, combined with their strong long-range flight capability, has helped great dragons become the consummate messengers. They can fly with news or warnings of danger across long distances, roaring out at regular intervals allowing settlements along their routes to receive word.

### Interspecies Relations and Assumptions

Most settlements of dragons across the world are visited by a number of great dragons over the year, who carry messages and light parcels to other parts of the world. Most major cities have enclaves suited to the needs of these larger dragons, a number of which will live there on a permanent basis. As such, great dragons are known and valued among all the dragons of the world - though individual relations as always differ greatly.
