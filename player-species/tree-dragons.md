Tree dragons
============

All but the coldest of the world's forests are home to the treehouse towns and cities of tree dragons. These **Smallest of dragons** are highly maneuverable fliers, gregarious and curious neighbors, avid culinarians and highly value athleticism.

Basic Information
-----------------

### Anatomy & Morphology

The smallest species of dragon, tree dragons usually reach an adult weight of only around a hundred pounds, with wingspans in the realm of 10 to 15 feet. Their wings are **Built for short flights through cluttered terrain**, with a low aspect ratio and low loading. As a result, they are highly maneuverable in the air, but need to flap vigorously to maintain airspeed. Their tails and necks are short, with more rounded, broad snouts than other species, which combines with their large eyes to make them look cute in the eyes of other dragons - a fact which tree dragon adults generally find highly irritating.

Tree dragons are **Excellent climbers** and highly arboreal, scaling vertical tree trunks with ease using their robust and sharp claws on all four limbs. They've been described as "running vertically" by some observers. While they can also climb rocks and similar, softer material is much preferred.

### Poison spray (stunt)

Tree dragons need exterior components for their breath weapon. Historically, they have chewed plants, swallowing the juices, but in newer times, the juices are brewed up for easy consumption. These juices are generally quite toxic, and when combined with the dragons' own secretions in the breath crop, can either be squirted as a coherent splash of poison, or sprayed as a mist to form an aerosol irritant cloud. Various ingested components yield different possible effects, ranging from light irritants to deadly necrotic toxin, and effective against a variety of targets.

### Ecology and Habitats

Tree dragons can be found wherever forests grow dense, and it does not get too cold. From equatorial jungles to temperate deciduous woods, major forests are likely to have settlements of tree dragons, made up of their famous tree houses.

### Dietary Needs and Habits

Broadly omnivorous, tree dragons will consume a wide variety of foods. From nature, they arose eating fruit and nuts from trees and bushes, fish and shellfish caught in streams and rivers, and insects and small vertebrate prey that they would hunt either from the air or on foot.

Modern tree dragon cuisine is widely respected and sought after, with wide variety and a reputation of having **Something for every palate**.

### Perception and Sensory Capabilities

Large eyes adapted for low light and high dynamic range make these dragons well adapted to a life in dense forest canopy. They also have excellent hearing, though they fall short of true echolocation.

Civilization and Culture
------------------------

### Average Technological Level

Their smaller size makes tree dragons apt to fine mechanics. Shaping small items with fine tolerances is a subject they have developed far, and significant amounts of fine-mechanical industry has tree dragon origins. Clocks and other such machinery is generally of tree dragon design and manufacture, as none of the other species can easily compete. This has also lead to some interesting discoveries among them in electrics.

### Culture and Cultural Heritage

Food culture is a major point of pride for tree dragons, and chefs often travel widely to learn new things. Most places in the world will happily welcome tree dragons on such a mission, their curiosity and skill at preparing food being renowned.

### Common Customs, Traditions and Rituals

While customs differ widely across the world, most tree dragon peoples have some form of flying competition. Most often these are based on gliding, typically involving passing a set of gates while losing as little altitude as possible, with the winner being the one to land at the highest point of the goal tree. Other competitions involve racing, typically relatively short distances but needing to traverse numerous difficult obstacles.
