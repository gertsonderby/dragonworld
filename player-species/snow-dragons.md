Snow dragons
============

Snowy conifer forests, windy tundras, sea ice, glaciers, and unrelentingly brutal winters are defining traits of the world's polar regions. Yet even here a species of dragons have made their home, the snow dragons.

Basic Information
-----------------

### Anatomy & Morphology

Adapted to hunt and live in polar and subpolar regions, adult snow dragons are large creatures with body weights of about a ton or more, with wingspans of 60 to 70'. Contrary to the other dragon species, snow dragons' bodies and limbs have **Thick, smooth fur** covering them, useful to resist cold winds and weather. As a consequence, snow dragon hatchlings are little balls of fluff, uniformly adored as cute. It does also mean that snow dragons are prone to lethargy in hot weather, and generally find the subtropics and tropics highly uncomfortable during the warmer months. Their feet and the knuckles of the forelimb have leathery, wide pads surrounded by stiff bristles, enabling them to effectively spread their weight and walk on thin ice, loose snow and other uncertain surfaces.

As **Night hunters**, snow dragons are able to fly silently, the fur covering their wing membranes absorbing what little noise their low wing loading would create. With very broad wings for their weight, snow dragons can glide undetected above tundras and snow forests, listening out for prey. Sharp and night-adapted eyesight enables them to spot their prey from the air, even through trees. Their robust forelimbs allow them to perform a shallow-angle aerial attack, effective at knocking over running prey even as large as elk, 5 times as heavy as their attacker. Their aerial abilities and fiery breath also combine to let them defend their settlements and territory from bears, wolves, and other large predators.

### Fiery breath (stunt)

Snow dragons' breath weapon is perhaps the most impressive of them all, as they spew forth a highly volatile liquid which will burst into flame within split seconds of contact with the air. While not themselves fire resistant, they usually launch this liquid at high speed, ensuring that it is well clear of their mouths as it ignites. They have historically used this to light cooking fires, melt ice and snow, thaw out permafrozen soil, and numerous other tasks.

### Ecology and Habitats

Most snow dragons live in temperate to polar climates, preferring cold weather to warm. However, populations are found around both poles, and it is uncertain which pole they evolved near.

Different adaptations and strategies have enabled them to survive equally well in snow forests, tundras, and even polar deserts and ice sheets. Different snow dragon peoples trade vigorously among each other and with their southern neighbors, allowing access to commodities not usually found at these extreme latitudes.

### Dietary Needs and Habits

Principal food sources vary by region and culture. Dragons inhabiting the coasts of polar seas hunt marine animals like [sea serpents](sea-serpents-article) and [wingfins](wingfins-article), as well as fishing both open and icy seas.

Tundras and forests provide larger prey, from as small as lemmings to as big as elk. With the right equipment and in groups, even solitary [hardnoses](skithas-article) are vulnerable.

### Perception and Sensory Capabilities

Better hearing than other dragons, and large, night-adapted eyes. Snow dragons sport the most light-adaptable eyes of any dragon species, allowing them good eyesight in light environments ranging from moonless nights to ice sheets in sunshine.

Scientific Name:   Draco nivis

Average Weight:   1-1.5 ton

Average Length:   60-70' wingspan

Body Tint, Colouring and Marking: Mostly white, light grey or blue, with black, grey, dark blue or brown contrast markings. Underbellies are often a darker color than upper surfaces. Elaborate facial markings are common.
