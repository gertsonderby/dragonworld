Dragonworld
===========

Player characters, and indeed all sapient creatures of this world, are dragons. Dragons range from smallish (150 lbs., 15' wingspan) to very large (5+ tons, 100+' wingspan), and all are sapient. Breath weapons are varied and typical, flight ability ranges from reluctant to soaring to acrobatic across the dragon species.

Dragons have built advanced societies and developed technology. Wars and disasters occur, and dragons respond to this. They patrol for enemies or other dangers, fly rescue missions, fight fires and floods, fly aid into dangerous areas, or fight each other in the air to fulfill these roles. All of these as well as more mundane or down-to-earth endeavors can be used as a setting for a campaign.

Young dragons are taught the use of their minds and bodies in organized ways. Dragon education typically starts out generalist, and allows for further specialization as the dragons age and advance along their chosen paths. Specialist flight schools teach prestigious, dangerous work, whether it's military, rescue work, or other areas that require specialized skills. These make for excellent campaign backdrops, ranging from high-school type stories in the vein of *The Breakfast Club* to elite advanced courses evoking *Top Gun*, or any combination imaginable.
