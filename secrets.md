# Secrets

## Scale

This world is scaled to measuring units around one third their normal (linear) size (i.e. area measurements will be 1/9th normal, volume and mass 1/27th). Dragon scaling is based on real-world pterosaurs of the late Cretaceous.

## Imported animals

Wingfins are based on plesiosaurs in all their diversity. Arries are "plesiosauromorph" animals, while brauks are "pliosauromorph".

Skithas are ceratopsians, specifically the hardnose is *Pachyrhinosaurus sp.*, the sharpcollar is *Styracosaurus sp.*, and the threehorn is *Triceratops sp.*
