Sea serpents
============

Enormous but mostly placid sea animals that breathe air. The smallest forms are around 90' long, with the biggest up to 300', with scholars guessing they might weigh thousands of tons. Sea serpents seem to share common ancestry with dragons, as many morphological traits are shared.

Basic Information
-----------------

### Anatomy & Morphology

A large, wide head with long jaws facilitate filter feeding, using their innumerable, thin and featherlike 'teeth' to sift water for krill and small fish. Nostrils located on the nasal crest enable breathing from the water's surface without rising very high out of the water, and while skimming along the surface.

### Genetics and Reproduction

Like most air-breathing sea creatures, sea serpents birth live young. Not much is known about their reproduction beyond that, and that they birth and then abandon a large number of offspring, only a few of which survive to adulthood.

### Growth Rate & Stages

A newborn sea serpent is quite small compared to its mother, typically only a few feet long and slender. They are born with short, robust teeth, not effective at filtering water but well suited to living as small shallow-water predators of fish and mollusks. This is also the riskiest stage of their life, as they have numerous predators themselves. Perhaps one in thirty juvenile sea serpents survive this stage of their life.

As they grow, their jaws grow faster than the remaining body, and at a year old, they start approaching the proportions of an adult, though they still have their 'baby teeth' and are maybe ten to fifteen percent adult size. Around this point, however, they instinctively head toward deeper waters and rapidly start shedding their short teeth. Within the next two weeks, the filter teeth of adulthood grow in, already becoming useful for filter feeding within a couple of days.

Oceangoing large predators favor the undersized subadult sea serpents, making this stage of life nearly as dangerous as the first year. Full adult size typically takes between four and ten years to achieve, though slow growth proceeds throughout life. Sea serpents have been known to live for almost a century, with reports of individuals suggesting up to twice that is possible.

### Ecology and Habitats

As juveniles, sea serpents live in shallow coastal waters, favoring reefs and other rich waters. They are ravenous predators of small fish, but are themselves targeted by large fish and marine mammals and reptiles.

Subadults and adults take to the open ocean seeking out krill blooms near the poles and fish schools around islands, often amazing sailors with their great size and majesty.

### Dietary Needs and Habits

Juvenile sea serpents feed primarily on smaller fish, jellyfish, mollusks and shellfish, using their robust teeth to capture and crush prey. As they grow their diet shifts away from hard shelled prey, as their lengthening jaws are unsuited to crushing these.

Adults feed on krill, zooplankton, and small fish and jellyfish. They capture these in huge numbers by filtering large mouthfuls of seawater through their feather-like teeth.

### Biological Cycle

Adult sea serpents migrate with the seasons as different species spawn and bloom in different locations. Polar krill blooms occur in spring as spawn emerges to the open sea, and is frequented by many species of sea serpent.

### Perception and Sensory Capabilities

Sea serpents have good eyesight for sea animals, but their primary sense is hearing. Some species locate fish schools by sound, and most species communicate with sound signals, which travel very well through water.

Conservation Status:   Large pods of these creatures are common. Some hunting takes place, but industrial exploitation has not proven feasible, so populations are largely stable.
