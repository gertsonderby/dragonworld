Wingfins
========

Large, air breathing marine reptiles, which propel themselves using their four limbs, shaped into winglike paddles.

Basic Information
-----------------

### Anatomy & Morphology

Two major types of wingfin exist, easily distinguishable from one another. Arries (sing. arry) are slow-swimming fishers with extremely long necks and small heads. Brauks are fast swimmers with compact bodies, short necks and massive heads, and predate other large sea life such as sharks and other large fish, small [sea serpents](/creatures/sea-serpents.md) or other wingfins. Many species exist within both these types, ranging from small freshwater forms to large ocean-going varieties.

### Uses, Products & Exploitation

Hunted by both [sea dragons](/player-species/sea-dragons.md) and [snow dragons](/player-species/snow-dragons.md) for their meat, blubber, hides and bones. Today, moreso by populations living according to old traditions.

### Perception and Sensory Capabilities

Arries primarily use scent to find fish, but have good hearing. Brauks tend to have better eyesight, but still rely more on scent and hearing. They do however have an electrical sense similar to that of sharks, allowing them better awareness of larger moving creatures in the water.

#### Average Physique

**Arry:** Rotund body, elongated neck, small and cone-shaped head with protruding, intermeshing teeth.

**Brauk:** Oblong body, short, robust neck, large, wedge-shaped head with long jaws, robust, sharp teeth.
