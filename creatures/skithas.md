Skithas
=======

Named for the impressive shield-like frills around the backs of their heads, skithas (sing. skitha) are massive animals, adults typically around a hundred tons. Most species have multiple horns on their noses or above the eyes, and large hexagonal scales covering their skins.

Three species are known, the mainly equatorial sharpcollar, recognizable by its massively spiked frill, the massive threehorn skitha which can be up to twice as big as the other species, and lastly, the tundra dwelling hardnose skitha, which has a flat boss across its nose and a thick coat of bristly fur.

Basic Information

### Anatomy & Morphology

Quadrupedal animals with heavy, solid limbs, deep and massive tails, and elongated, beaked heads, skithas are built to carry their weight, many being fast runners. Skitha heads are both their most extreme feature and the easiest way to tell them apart.

Conservation Status:   While skithas are uncommon, they are not endangered. Populations of
    the various species are healthy and appear stable.
